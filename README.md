# ExPrac: Truth Verification & AI Essay Console

ExPrac is a powerful Terminal User Interface (TUI) designed for high-speed fact-checking and material-driven essay generation. It combines multiple LLM providers with locally managed "Banks" to provide reliable, context-aware information processing.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Fact Checking & Truth Verification
- **Multi-Provider Fallback**: Automatically switches between Gemini, OpenAI, and other providers if rate limits are hit.
- **Statement Bank**: Maintain a local database of known truths and falsehoods.
- **Hybrid Verification**: Checks against your local bank first (Exact & Fuzzy) before querying global AI knowledge.
- **Persistence**: All verification queries and results are saved to `data/sv_history.json`.

### ✍️ AI Essay Generation
- **Material Bank**: Upload PDFs or text files to provide grounded context for AI-written essays.
- **Essay Bank**: Import your previous writing examples to help the AI match your unique style and tone.
- **Real-time Status**: Track "Uploading", "Generating", and rate-limit countdowns directly in the TUI.
- **Automatic History**: All essay tasks are persisted to `data/essay_history.json`.

### 🖥️ Advanced TUI Experience
- **Scrollable Tabs**: Navigate easily between Fact-Checking, Essay Writing, and Management views.
- **Persistent State**: The app remembers your last active tab and restores it on launch.
- **Smart Commands**: Feature-rich command line with autocompletion for paths, subcommands, and bank items.
